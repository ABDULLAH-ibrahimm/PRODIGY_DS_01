Population Distribution Visualization Project
This project focuses on visualizing population distribution using data from the World Bank. As part of the analysis, I processed and transformed the dataset to extract key insights into demographic patterns, including age and gender distributions.

Key Features:
- Data Cleaning:
Handled missing values, filtered relevant columns, and reshaped the data for analysis.
Simulated Age & Gender Data: Created synthetic age and gender data to enrich the dataset.
- Visualization:
Bar chart of population distribution by age group and gender.
Histogram of population distribution for the year 2020.


-- The project showcases my skills in data manipulation and visualization using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
